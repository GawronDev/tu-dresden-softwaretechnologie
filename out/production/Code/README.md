# Softwartechnologie SS2023 course at TU Dresden

## Overview
This course outlines the skills and knowledge that students will learn in the future regarding the development of software systems. Students will be taught methods for software development that involve an engineering approach using object-oriented concepts and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for analysis, design, and implementation. They will also receive training on the programming language Java, with an emphasis on using class libraries and design patterns for practical implementation of software systems. In addition, they will be introduced to the fundamentals of project management and software quality assurance to ensure the successful delivery of high-quality software products.

## What is this repository?

I'm using this repository to showcase my progress with learning a new programming language - **Java**. Hopefully by the end of the semester it will be filled with intresting projects and apps.
